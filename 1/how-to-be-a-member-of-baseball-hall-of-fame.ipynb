First we must learn what happening in Hall Of Fame, so we take an exploration in it. We found if we voted by somebody like **Veterans**, we will have a higher oppotunity to the HOF. Some year we really have a high rate of being admitted into HOF, the time is also a very important factor to HOF.\n2. We have a explortion in player's biographic data and we found to be a member HOF really all have around 10 years experience and their body infomation shouldn't not be an outlier, to cater our fans passion.  \n3. To be a HOF, we see the member of HOF have excellent skills to outperform other normal players. In the battlefield, skill talks.  \n4. A member of HOF may not take the highest salary, however, because they should have magic sleeves, their salary are surely above most people. But high salary does not qualify them to HOF.\n5. The one in the HOF may not have a lot awrards, but some award such as **Triple Crown** almost all admitted into HOF. In our imagnation, player hits many triple hit or homerun is truly a legend.  \n\n## Drawback declartion  \nThere should be some mistakes in this project such as:  \n1. dealing with the missing values, when there's NAN, i always use 0 to fill it.\n2. The variables could have correlation, so not all the conclusion are causation inference but correlation.  \n\n## Future Work \nTruly, the dataset is very huge, there're still a lot info we can mining, for example:  \n1. player's performance is a huge goldmine.  \n2. their team performance  \n\nI will stop here. Thank for the people reading my work.\n"}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
