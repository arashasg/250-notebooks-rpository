{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**How far should the 3-pt line actually be?**\n\nI just finished the book SprawlBall by Kirk Goldsberry. In it, the author talks about how the 3 point line has changed the incentive structure in basketball. The points per shot (aka the expected value of the shot) for three pointers and layups are significantly greater there than anywhere else inbetween. This got me thinking, if the NBA were to make a rule change mandating where the 3 point line should actually be, what is the \"fairest\" distance for them to move it to? Also, if they were to implement a 4 point line, where should that be located? \n\nI will also profile how this would impact Steph Curry, the most prolific 3 point shooter ever. \n\nThe current 3 point line sits at 23.75' from the rim around the greater arc, but at the corners it is at 22'. For simplicity, I will be making it so that the arc will be a stead curve that is equidistant from the rim at all parts in my analysis.\n\n* It should be noted that this data is from the 2014-2015 season. It is likely that there is an even larger skew towards the 3-point shot in todays basketball.
