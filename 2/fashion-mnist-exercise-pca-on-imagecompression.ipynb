Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Scope\nAny image contains lots of redundant data. For example, many adjoining pixels would have the same color. Therefore, there is a huge scope to reduce the number of columns in an image using PCA. This example shows how even by reducing dimensionality of any image in this dataset from 1 X 784 to 1 X 187, image is till preserved and when plotted is clearly recognizable."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Call libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Check version of sklearn.\n# There should not be any assertion error\nimport sklearn\nassert sklearn.__version__ >= \"0.20\"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Read dataset\nX = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fashionmnist/fashion-mnist_train.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X.shape\nX.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Copy the first column 'label' (target) to 'y' array and remove it\ny = X.pop('label')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X.shape     \ny.shape     ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Split dataset.
