SVMs are more commonly used in classification problems and as such, this is what we will focus on in this post.\n\nSVMs are based on the idea of finding a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into two classes, as shown in the image below\n<img src=\"https://image.ibb.co/g0rmWp/svm1.png\" alt=\"class\">\n\nSupport vectors are the data points nearest to the hyperplane, the points of a data set that, if removed, would alter the position of the dividing hyperplane. Because of this, they can be considered the critical elements of a data set.\n\n**What is a hyperplane?**\n \nAs a simple example, for a classification task with only two features (like the image above), you can think of a hyperplane as a line that linearly separates and classifies a set of data.\n\nIntuitively, the further from the hyperplane our data points lie, the more confident we are that they have been correctly classified. We therefore want our data points to be as far away from the hyperplane as possible, while still being on the correct side of it.\n\nSo when new testing data is added, whatever side of the hyperplane it lands will decide the class that we assign to it.\n\n**How do we find the right hyperplane?**\n \nOr, in other words, how do we best segregate the two classes within the data?\n\nThe distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point from either set is known as the margin. The goal is to choose a hyperplane with the greatest possible margin between the hyperplane and any point within the training set, giving a greater chance of new data being classified correctly.\n<img src=\"https://image.ibb.co/mU6Lrp/svm2.png\" alt=\"class\">"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6979f59c853ccf8aefbae39f03eaa597d22abe5d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.svm import SVC \nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix\n\nsvc_model = SVC()\nsvc_model.fit(X_train, y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5b27940c9dd09b2b2dfdbe4cc2be172300be285a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"y_predict = svc_model.predict(X_test)\ncm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_predict)\ncm","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"712d2f7a5ae8c634f7c60eb97810a744f9da9cd6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4ccdd40db5fd1bdda051e6f4a78ffa9067aa8172"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(classification_report(y_test, y_predict))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"fa9fe535e88c74c92db903640ea3c0de8cad57f1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"min_train = X_train.min()\nmin_train","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2205956656f4683ef7524b66b142c90c705dc2f1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"range_train = (X_train - min_train).max()\nrange_train","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6ca68416d6687fdb301128adc2c988b05027e7d2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train_scaled = (X_train - min_train)/range_train","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"69baa3c483d15f01c443c95184765d62223f6499"},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train_scaled.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e96aac8bef795955804615ffc6fb6f6e306413fb"},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.scatterplot(x = X_train['area_mean'], y = X_train['smoothness_mean'], hue = y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2206ee56b7de49c76a8bfe7f69bd2c1056fa494c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.scatterplot(x = X_train_scaled['area_mean'], y = X_train_scaled['smoothness_mean'], hue = y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4e0a9b18313358981c64ca3961620717da713ccd"},"cell_type":"code","source":"min_test = X_test.min()\nrange_test = (X_test - min_test).max()\nX_test_scaled = (X_test - min_test)/range_test","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"43a3806ff6aa11d888585267ea570160d98cff85"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.svm import SVC \nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix\n\nsvc_model = SVC()\nsvc_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4893f92c2135ecaeb4bb97bd57dd1706358be14a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"y_predict = svc_model.predict(X_test_scaled)\ncm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_predict)\n\nsns.heatmap(cm,annot=True,fmt=\"d\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"44bdd6bcc88cf6d38d09487f1c293c5232a9f9e4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(classification_report(y_test,y_predict))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0698b3b5558a88ab7c906d1674dbb446038823cc"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Improving the model using** **GridSearchCV** <br>\nwhat is **GridSearch ?** <br>\nGrid Search is an algorithm with the help of which we can tune hyper-parameters of a model. We pass the hyper-parameters to tune, the possible values for each hyper-parameter and a performance metric as input to the grid search algorithm. The algorithm will then place all the possible hyper-parameter combination in a grid and then find the performance of the model for each combination against some cross-validation set. Then it outputs the hyper-parameter combination that gives the best result.\n\nGridSearch is generally used when you are not sure of good values for a parameter. We might have a range of parameter values that you think would work out for the model and you want to test which one of them to use. In that situation it becomes tedious for us to train the model again and again with different parameters and in that situation we use gridSearch.\n\nLet us suppose that : To solve the optimization problem for a fixed set of values of hyperparameters α and β gives us a value of w. Since the optimal value of w (call it w∗) is a function of α and β, we can write it as follows:\n\n**w∗(α,β)=argminwP(w,α,β,Strain)**\n\nNow we use this w∗ to predict on the validation sample to get validation error. We can view this scenario in terms of a \"validation error function\": the function takes as inputs the hyperparameters α and β, and returns the validation error corresponding to w∗(α,β).\n\nSo the goal of hyperparameter optimization is to find the set of values of α and β, that minimize this validation error function.\n\nSo, in Grid Search technique, it picks a bunch of values of α -- (α1,α2,…) and a bunch of values of β -- (β1,β2,…) and for each pair of values, evaluates the validation error function. Then pick the pair that gives the minimum value of the validation error function.\n\nThe pairs (α1,β1),(α1,β2),…,(α2,β1),(α2,β2),… when plotted in space look like a grid, hence the name.\n<img src=\"https://image.ibb.co/gJFfSU/grid123.png\" alt=\"claass\" border=\"0\">"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"377e4e0e92459be10aadbd6b46a94439da2125d2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100], 'gamma': [1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001], 'kernel': ['rbf']} ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"415de9d6a50c996ddfd6936b00b67fbf152bb337"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"cf485cee352e73dd2398c0a588dc0fdfb86d2136"},"cell_type":"code","source":"grid = GridSearchCV(SVC(),param_grid,refit=True,verbose=4)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ab227e28cf3efd4287e815e518c2d2740fc81ce5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"grid.fit(X_train_scaled,y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e1e6ed53f462d1702502aab125770c59dc4069d9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"grid.best_params_","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"cef9970b3c2ecdfb5a785314ca6beb2f28314cb8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"grid.best_estimator_","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6d68e47beaca248d3f32fcc6e4a90122c2438c37"},"cell_type":"code","source":"grid_predictions = grid.predict(X_test_scaled)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8493fb5941ae584bea86bc12599b69a7161972f1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, grid_predictions)\nsns.heatmap(cm,annot=True,fmt=\"d\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ff20fe408dd1d4a04eeeb4f951c5ea42c37b60a7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(classification_report(y_test,grid_predictions))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"522b771bbef5a0dc57993fe5c607495d1c4a3bf1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"That's Great we have achieved 97% accuracy and precision to detect malignant or benign breast cancer."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"66390d89c391879233d223efe356345050712088"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Reference **  <br>\n1.   https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)\n2.  https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/07/support-vector-machines-simple-explanation.html"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
