With each day new restaurants opening the industry hasâ€™nt been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day.\n\nThis Zomato data aims at analysing demography of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarity between neighborhoods of Bengaluru on the basis of food. The dataset also contains reviews for each of the restaurant which will help in finding overall rating for the place.The data is accurate to that available on the zomato website until 15 March 2019. The data was scraped from Zomato in two phase. After going through the structure of the website I found that for each neighborhood there are 6-7 category of restaurants viz. Buffet, Cafes, Delivery, Desserts, Dine-out, Drinks & nightlife, Pubs and bars."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\n%matplotlib inline\n\n#set the style \nsns.set_style('whitegrid')\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 14,7\nplt.style.use(\"seaborn\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load Data"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#load the data\nzomato_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/zomato.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"zomato_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Dictionary:\n\n* url - contains the url of the restaurant in the zomato website\n* address - contains the address of the restaurant in Bengaluru\n* name - contains the name of the restaurant\n* online_order - whether online ordering is available in the restaurant or not\n* book_table - table book option available or not\n* rate - contains the overall rating of the restaurant out of 5\n* votes - contains total number of rating for the restaurant as of the above mentioned date\n* phone - contains the phone number of the restaurant\n* location - contains the neighborhood in which the restaurant is located\n* rest_type - restaurant type\n* dish_liked - dishes people liked in the restaurant\n* cuisines - food styles, separated by comma\n* approx_cost(for two people) - contains the approximate cost for meal for two people\n* reviews_list - list of tuples containing reviews for the restaurant, each tuple consists of two values, rating and review by the customer\n* menu_item - contains list of menus available in the restaurant\n* listed_in(type) - type of meal\n* listed_in(city) - contains the neighborhood in which the restaurant is listed"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#shape of the dataset\nzomato_data.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Basic Data Understanding"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"zomato_data.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"zomato_data.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#get the datatypes of the columns\nzomato_data.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#count of data types\nzomato_data.get_dtype_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Only the variable `votes` is read as an integer, remaining 16 columns are read as objects"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#basic stats\nzomato_data.describe() #only for votes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#check for missing values\n\npd.DataFrame(round(zomato_data.isnull().sum()/zomato_data.shape[0] * 100,3), columns = [\"Missing\"])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* The variable `dish_liked` as more than 54 % of missing data.
