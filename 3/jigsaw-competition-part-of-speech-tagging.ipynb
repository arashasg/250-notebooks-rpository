Another example is the word \"smartest\". It is a superlative adjective, so its PoS tag would be JJS, which is the NLTK tag for superlative adjective.\n\nHere are all the PoS tags supported by NLTK :\n\n* CC coordinating conjunction\n\n* CD cardinal digit\n\n* DT determiner\n\n* EX existential there (like: “there is” … think of it like “there exists”)\n\n* FW foreign word\n\n* IN preposition/subordinating conjunction\n\n* JJ adjective ‘big’\n\n* JJR adjective, comparative ‘bigger’\n\n* JJS adjective, superlative ‘biggest’\n\n* LS list marker 1)\n\n* MD modal could, will\n\n* NN noun, singular ‘desk’\n\n* NNS noun plural ‘desks’\n\n* NNP proper noun, singular ‘Harrison’\n\n* NNPS proper noun, plural ‘Americans’\n\n* PDT predeterminer ‘all the kids’\n\n* POS possessive ending parent’s\n\n* PRP personal pronoun I, he, she\n\n* PRP$ possessive pronoun my, his, hers\n\n* RB adverb very, silently,\n\n* RBR adverb, comparative better\n\n* RBS adverb, superlative best\n\n* RP particle give up\n\n* TO, to go ‘to’ the store.\n\n* UH interjection, errrrrrrrm\n    \n* VB verb, base form take\n\n* VBD verb, past tense took\n\n* VBG verb, gerund/present participle taking\n\n* VBN verb, past participle taken\n\n* VBP verb, sing. present, non-3d take\n\n* VBZ verb, 3rd person sing. present takes\n\n* WDT wh-determiner which\n\n* WP wh-pronoun who, what\n\n* WP$ possessive wh-pronoun whose\n\n* WRB wh-abverb where, when\n\nNow since we know what PoS tagging is, let's apply it on all the comments in the train data (actually only a sample) and see if we can extract useful insights from these PoS features !"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Preparing ground for analysis"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, tokenization and PoS Tagging"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\ntqdm.pandas()\n\nfrom nltk import word_tokenize, pos_tag\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Define size of train data and sample size"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"DATA_LEN = 1804874\nSAMPLE_SIZE = 100000","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Randomly select rows to skip during loading of the train data (we load only 100k comments and leave the remainder of the data)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rows = np.arange(0, DATA_LEN)\nskip_rows = list(np.random.choice(rows[1:], DATA_LEN - SAMPLE_SIZE, replace=False))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Load data while skipping pre-decided rows"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv', skiprows=skip_rows)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Tokenize all comments in the sample and generate PoS tags for them using NLTK.
