It gives machines the ability to think and learn on their own. The key motivation for deep learning is to build algorithms that mimic the human brain. \n\nTo achieve this we need to feed as much as relevant data for the models to learn. Unlike machine learning algorithms the deep learning algorithms learning won’t be saturated with feeding more data. But feeding more data to deep learning models will lead to overfitting issue.\n\nThat’s why developing a more generalized deep learning model is always a challenging problem to solve. Usually, we need more data to train the deep learning model. In order to get an efficient score we have to feed more data to the model. But unfortunately, in some cases, we face issues with a lack of data. \n\nOne of the most common problems with building neural networks is overfitting. The key reason is, the build model is not generalized well and it’s well-optimized only for the training dataset. In layman terms, the model memorized how to predict the target class only for the training dataset. \n\n\nThe other cases overfitting usually happens when we don’t have enough data, or because of complex architectures without regularizations.\n\nIf we don't have the sufficient data to feed, the model will fail to capture the trend in data. It tries to understand each and every data point in training data and performs poorly on test/unseen data."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1> Techniques to Handle Overfitting In Deep Learning</h1>\n\n* Regularization\n* Dropout\n* Data Augmentation\n* Early stopping"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Model with overfitting issue\n\nNow we are going to build a deep learning model which suffers from overfitting issue.
