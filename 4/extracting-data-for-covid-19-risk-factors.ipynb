The rapid growth of new literature on coronaviruses is making it extremely difficult for the medical research community  to keep up with the recent updates. As a result, there is a huge demand for these approaches in order to help the scientific research community.\n\nText data is not random, but has linguistic properties, which makes it very understandable for other people and computer-processable <hr/>\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Methodology**: \n1. Due to the huge size of the data and our specific main goal concerning Covid-19, we extracted a number of abstracts that openly studied Covid-19 and its derivatives.\n2. Tokenization and data preprocessing such as stemming, lemmatization and removing stop words was done using sciSpacy on the abstracts. [scispaCy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/) is a Python package containing spaCy models for processing biomedical, scientific or clinical text.\n3. The abstracts were embedded into a TF-IDF Model to calculate the TF-IDF vectors. \n4. The cosine similarity of a **dynamic user query** was calculated against each of the abtracts. \n5. The next step is to sort the most similar papers to the given query and display the 10 most relevant papers. \n\nThis allows the medical research community, governments, and decision-makers to rapidly consult the latest findings and discoveries in a given knowledge area. **Also the dynamic search queries will help researchers to search for anything related to Covid-19 **. Links to the full-text research paper are also embedded and directly clickable in the output dataframe. <hr/>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Pros:**\n1. An efficient query answering system that returns the most relevant literature.\n1. Easy and Rapid Access to the Latest Findings in a Given knowledge area.\n\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1.
