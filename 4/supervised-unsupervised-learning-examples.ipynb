Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.\n\nThe process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.\n\n# **Some machine learning methods**\nMachine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised.\n\n**Supervised machine learning** *algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Starting from the analysis of a known training dataset, the learning algorithm produces an inferred function to make predictions about the output values. The system is able to provide targets for any new input after sufficient training. The learning algorithm can also compare its output with the correct, intended output and find errors in order to modify the model accordingly.\n\n\nIn contrast, **unsupervised machine learning** algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled. Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. The system doesn’t figure out the right output, but it explores the data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.\n\n\n**Semi-supervised machine learning** algorithms fall somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised learning, since they use both labeled and unlabeled data for training – typically a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The systems that use this method are able to considerably improve learning accuracy. Usually, semi-supervised learning is chosen when the acquired labeled data requires skilled and relevant resources in order to train it / learn from it. Otherwise, acquiringunlabeled data generally doesn’t require additional resources.\n\n\n**Reinforcement machine learning** algorithms is a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Trial and error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning. This method allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn which action is best; this is known as the reinforcement signal.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e851af2892b9cff5b0b97eb2072325ad97a345d4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Regression Analysis**\n\nRegression analysis is a reliable method of identifying which variables have impact on a topic of interest.

Unsupervised learning means that there is no outcome to be predicted, and the algorithm just tries to find patterns in the data. In k means clustering, we have the specify the number of clusters we want the data to be grouped into. The algorithm randomly assigns each observation to a cluster, and finds the centroid of each cluster. Then, the algorithm iterates through two steps:\nReassign data points to the cluster whose centroid is closest. Calculate new centroid of each cluster. These two steps are repeated till the within cluster variation cannot be reduced any further. The within cluster variation is calculated as the sum of the euclidean distance between the data points and their respective cluster centroids.\n\n![](http://bolubeyi.net/wp-content/uploads/kumeleme.png)\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2c974694ed6c5e2e94e8cab8d0899ac25791cce8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"124de71dd0cd6c73af03b63c089f48b506cd8df7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = make_blobs(n_samples=200, n_features=2, \n                           centers=4, cluster_std=1.8,random_state=101)  ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1079764547481c681483c140e975dffe8f653186"},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.scatter(data[0][:,0],data[0][:,1],c=data[1],cmap='rainbow') ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"29dcbd363fbe944d4fc91de528a967cb470f5df9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4)\nkmeans.fit(data[0])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1894fbf713ad3faf5e7ce7815f337aa7be559cb2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"kmeans.cluster_centers_  ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8426973ddc76e45f781f342c5ee03838fba468a0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"kmeans.labels_","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5ea4e331ddd02aceb1b6a3933844c67b661a76f8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"f, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharey=True,figsize=(10,6))\nax1.set_title('K Means')\nax1.scatter(data[0][:,0],data[0][:,1],c=kmeans.labels_,cmap='rainbow')\nax2.set_title(\"Original\")\nax2.scatter(data[0][:,0],data[0][:,1],c=data[1],cmap='rainbow')   ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f9ce58867a6901f4d967de317397117161a45718"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### If you like it, please vote\n# Thank you :)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
