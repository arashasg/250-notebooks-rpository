Ion channels are pore-forming proteins present in animals and plants. They encode learning and memory, help fight infections, enable pain signals, and stimulate muscle contraction. If scientists could better study ion channels, which may be possible with the aid of machine learning, it could have a far-reaching impact.\n\n\n\nWhen ion channels open, they pass electric currents. Existing methods of detecting these state changes are slow and laborious. Humans must supervise the analysis, which imparts considerable bias, in addition to being tedious. These difficulties limit the volume of ion channel current analysis that can be used in research. Scientists hope that technology could enable rapid automatic detection of ion channel current events in raw data.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Objective of the Competition**\n\n![](https://www.nature.com/scitable/content/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/14707004/U4CP3-1_IonChannel_ksm.jpg)\n\n\nIn this competition, contestants are challenged to predict the number of open ion channels using electrophysiological signals from human cells.
